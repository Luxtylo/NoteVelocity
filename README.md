Note-taking project
===================

An EPQ project for designing and making a note-taking program for university and A-level students. My aim is to have syntax like markdown and Python, but functionality like LaTeX.
Made using *Python* and *Kivy*, although this may be changed to us a *Python* backend and an *HTML and CSS* frontend for ease of programming.

UI is currently **non-functional**

Function is currently **WIP**

As of 04/05/13, */Source/Functionality/function.py* will take the input from */Source/Functionality/Notes* and make an *output.html*

Functionality is *slightly* further explained in *Source/Functionality/functionPlanning.txt*
