NoteVelocity
===================
A note-taking program
---------------------

This is an EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) project for designing and making a note-taking program for university and A-level students. My aim is to have syntax like markdown and Python, but functionality like LaTeX.
Made using *Python* and *Tkinter*.

The OldSource folder shows my progress when messing around with Python and Tkinter, before I did the research to actually find out what the project needs. Now that I have I'll be restarting the coding, using what I learned when writing the OldSource to guide me. The OldSource folder will be removed in several commits, as it will only be cluttering the project.

**Dependencies (for OldSource):**
* *Python* >= *3.3*, as of commit 47
* tkinter *(Included with Python on Windows and Mac)*
