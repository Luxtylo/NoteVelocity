Main idea
	Note-taking app with features similar to TeX, syntax like Markdown and Python, and a UI like Zune.
		Multiple font set options available
			Use dictionaries to store font sets?
				One that looks like a scientific paper
				One more modern-looking one (Use for report)
				Ability to make new font sets
		Syntax
			Short, markdown-like ways of formatting text
				e.g. *italic*, __underlined__
			Indentation matters, like Python
				First level is headings, second is subheadings
				Curly brackets make a heading into a title
