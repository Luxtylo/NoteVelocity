Main idea
	Note-taking app with features similar to TeX, syntax like Markdown and Python, and a UI like Zune.
		Multiple font set options available
			Use dictionaries to store font sets?
				One that looks like a scientific paper
				One more modern-looking one (Use for report)
				Ability to make new font sets
		Syntax
			Short, markdown-like ways of formatting text
				e.g. *italic*, __underlined__
			Indentation matters, like Python
				First level is headings, second is subheadings
				Curly brackets make a heading into a title

Currently implemented syntax
	*text*
		Italicises stuff
	_text_
		Underlined
		Does not work in equations
			Can be worked around by putting underscores outside equation tags
	<text>
		Bold
	~text~
		Strikethrough
	* text
		Bullet point
	[x + y]
		Equation
		Changes font (currently makes bold and italic)
	[x^(y)]
		Superscript
		Only works in equations
	[x_(y)]
		Subscript
		Only works in equations

Planned syntax
	[Link name](URL)
		Adds a link to the text
	|text|
		Box around text
	#text#
		Footnote (automatically numbered)
		Could also be some sort of inline note
	Tab detection to keep indentation
		Using "\t"
	(Numerator)/(Denominator)
		Fraction
